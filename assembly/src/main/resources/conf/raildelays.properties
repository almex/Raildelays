#
# There are basic settings of the application (including the list of train).
# From the default settings you probably would like to modify departure station,
# arrival station and language to match your use.
# You can also change destination of output files (text format and Excel sheet).
# The only possible values, for now, for the Excel template are :
# - resources/template.xls (OLE2 format before Office 2003)
# - resources/template.xlsx (OOXML format since Office 2003)
# Meaning that you should change the Excel output file extension accordingly.
# You can also modify those templates to already include your personal
# information. Therefor they will be copied for all Excel files produced by the
# application.
